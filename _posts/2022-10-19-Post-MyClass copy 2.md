_This is my exercise app_ 

Introduction:< br>
In this blog post, I'll continue exploring the Django project designed for managing body exercises. The focus will be on the role of prompts (parameters) within various functions to handle and display information related to different body sections and exercises.

Functions and Prompts:

Function exercise_list:

Prompts: This function, by default, retrieves and displays all exercises and body parts.
Parameters: request (database input)
Functions body_part_detail, arm_detail, leg_detail, back_detail, abs_detail:

Prompts: These functions provide information related to various body sections.
Parameters: request (database input) and part (body section)
Functions add_exercise and show_exercise:

Prompts: These functions receive and display information about adding new exercises and showing existing ones.
Parameters: request (database input)
Functions arm_view, leg_view, abs_view, back_view:

Prompts: These functions display information related to different body sections.
Parameters: request (database input)
Explanations:

In the program, the part parameter serves as a crucial prompt for determining the desired body section. It plays a significant role in fetching section-specific information.
Different functions use prompts to retrieve and display information about exercises and various body sections.
The get_exercises_for_part function is a simple example of how exercises are retrieved based on a specific body section.
The section for adding exercises (add_exercise) uses prompts from the form data in POST requests.
Conclusion:
In this Django project, prompts play a vital role in determining the desired body section and fetching information related to exercises. Each function uses prompts to display information about a specific body section, contributing to the improvement of the program's structure and capabilities.

Project Overview:
This Django project focuses on managing body exercises. It utilizes prompts to enhance the functionality of displaying and handling information about various body sections and exercises.
